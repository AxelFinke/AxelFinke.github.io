<h2><strong>Research interests</strong></h2>
<p>I am working on methodology for&nbsp;computationally intensive Bayesian and Frequentist statistics with a focus on the analysis of&nbsp;exact and approximate Monte Carlo methods in high dimensions as well as&nbsp;applications in&nbsp;epigenetics, ecology, econometrics, finance.</p>
<h2><strong>Publications</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Code</strong></h2>
<p>I am in the process of making my C++/RCpp code for various sequential Monte Carlo and particle MCMC method available on Github. Eventually, these will be available from my&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AxelFinke/monte-carlo-rcpp">monte-carlo-rcpp repository</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Other research-related activity</strong></h2>
<p>I also maintain a&nbsp;<a href="https://publons.com/author/600635/axel-finke#profile">Publons</a> profile for my peer-review activity.</p>
